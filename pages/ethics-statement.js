                  Editors evaluate submitted manuscripts exclusively on the basis of their
                  academic merit (importance, originality, study’s validity, clarity) and its
                  relevance to the journal’s scope, without regard to the authors’ race,
                  gender, sexual orientation, ethnic origin, citizenship, religious belief,
                  political philosophy or institutional affiliation. Decisions to edit and
                  publish are not determined by the policies of governments or any other
                  agencies outside of the journal itself. The Editor-in-Chief has full
                  authority over the entire editorial content of the journal and the timing of
                  publication of that content.&nbsp;

                  interest resulting from competitive, collaborative, or other
                  relationships/connections with any of the authors, companies or institutions

                <p>
                  The editors ensure that all submitted manuscripts being considered for
                  publication undergo peer-review by at least two reviewers who are expert in
                  the field. The Editor-in-Chief is responsible for deciding which of the
                  manuscripts submitted to the journal will be published, based on the
                  validation of the work in question, its importance to researchers and
                  readers, the reviewers’ comments, and such legal requirements as are
                  currently in force regarding libel, copyright infringement and plagiarism.
                  The Editor-in-Chief may confer with other editors or reviewers in making

                  Editors (in conjunction with the publisher and/or society) will take
                  responsive measures when ethical concerns are raised with regard to a
                  submitted manuscript or published paper. Every reported act of unethical
                  publishing behaviour will be looked into, even if it is discovered years
                  after publication. AP-SMART editors follow the COPE&nbsp;

                  the ethical concern is well-founded, a correction, retraction, expression of
                  concern or other note as may be relevant, will be published in the journal.

                  Peer review assists editors in making editorial decisions and, through
                  editorial communications with authors, may assist authors in improving their
                  manuscripts. Peer review is an essential component of formal scholarly
                  communication and lies at the heart of scientific endeavour. AP-SMART shares
                  the view of many that all scholars who wish to contribute to the scientific
                  process have an obligation to do a fair share of reviewing.

                <p>
                  Any invited referee who feels unqualified to review the research reported in
                  a manuscript or knows that its prompt review will be impossible should
                  immediately notify the editors and decline the invitation to review so that
                  alternative reviewers can be contacted.

                  Any manuscripts received for review are confidential documents and must be
                  treated as such; they must not be shown to or discussed with others except
                  if authorized by the Editor-in-Chief (who would only do so under exceptional
                  and specific circumstances). This applies also to invited reviewers who

                <p>
                  Reviews should be conducted objectively and observations formulated clearly
                  with supporting arguments so that authors can use them for improving the
                  manuscript. Personal criticism of the authors is inappropriate.

                  Reviewers should identify relevant published work that has not been cited by

                  that has been reported in previous publications should be accompanied by the
                  relevant citation. A reviewer should also notify the editors of any
                  substantial similarity or overlap between the manuscript under consideration
                  and any other manuscript (published or unpublished) of which they have

                  Authors of original research should present an accurate account of the work
                  performed and the results, followed by an objective discussion of the
                  significance of the work. The manuscript should contain sufficient detail
                  and references to permit others to replicate the work. Review articles
                  should be accurate, objective and comprehensive, while editorial 'opinion'
                  or perspective pieces should be clearly identified as such. Fraudulent or
                  knowingly inaccurate statements constitute unethical behaviour and are

                  Authors may be asked to provide the raw data of their study together with
                  the manuscript for editorial review and should be prepared to make the data
                  publicly available if practicable. In any event, authors should ensure
                  accessibility of such data to other competent professionals for at least 10
                  years after publication (preferably via an institutional or subject-based
                  data repository or other data centre), provided that the confidentiality of
                  the participants can be protected and legal rights concerning proprietary
                  data do not preclude their release.

                  Authors should ensure that they have written and submit only entirely
                  original works, and if they have used the work and/or words of others, that
                  this has been appropriately cited. Publications that have been influential
                  in determining the nature of the work reported in the manuscript should also
                  be cited. Plagiarism takes many forms, from "passing off" another's paper as
                  the author's own, to copying or paraphrasing substantial parts of another's
                  paper (without attribution), to claiming results from research conducted by
                  others. Plagiarism in all its forms constitutes unethical publishing
                  behaviour and is unacceptable.

                  Papers describing essentially the same research should not be published in

                  The publication of some kinds of articles (such as clinical guidelines,
                  translations) in more than one journal is sometimes justifiable, provided
                  that certain conditions are met. The authors and editors of the journals
                  concerned must agree to the secondary publication, which must reflect the
                  same data and interpretation of the primary document. The primary reference
                  must be cited in the secondary publication.

                  If the work involves chemicals, procedures or equipment that have any
                  unusual hazards inherent in their use, the authors must clearly identify
                  these in the manuscript. If the work involves the use of animals or human
                  participants, the authors should ensure that all procedures were performed
                  in compliance with relevant laws and institutional guidelines and that the
                  appropriate institutional committee(s) has approved them; the manuscript
                  should contain a statement to this effect. Authors should also include a
                  statement in the manuscript that informed consent was obtained for
                  experimentation with human participants. The privacy rights of human
                  participants must always be observed.

                  Authors are obliged to participate in the peer review process and cooperate
                  fully by responding promptly to editors’ requests for raw data,
                  clarifications, and proof of ethics approval, patient consents and copyright
                  permissions. In the case of a first decision of "revisions necessary",
                  authors should respond to the reviewers’ comments systematically, point by
                  point, and in a timely manner, revising and re-submitting their manuscript
                  to the journal by the deadline given.

                  When authors discover significant errors or inaccuracies in their own
                  published work, it is their obligation to promptly notify the journal’s
                  editors or publisher and cooperate with them to either correct the paper in
                  the form of an erratum or to retract the paper. If the editors or publisher
                  learns from a third party that a published work contains a significant error
                  or inaccuracy, then it is the authors’ obligation to promptly correct or
                  retract the paper or provide evidence to the journal editors of the
                  correctness of the paper.&nbsp;

                <p>
                  In cases of alleged or proven scientific misconduct, fraudulent publication
                  or plagiarism, the publisher, in close collaboration with the editors, will
                  take all appropriate measures to clarify the situation and to amend the
                  article in question. This includes the prompt publication of an erratum,
                  clarification or, in the most severe case, the retraction of the affected
                  work. &nbsp;The publisher, together with the editors, shall take reasonable
                  steps to identify and prevent the publication of papers where research
                  misconduct has occurred, and under no circumstances encourage such
                  misconduct or knowingly allow such misconduct to take place.
